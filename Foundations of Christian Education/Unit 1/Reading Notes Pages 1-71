##### Danger of Neglecting the Foundations
* Without the foundations of Christian education we lack a unified understanding of what Christian education is, what it should do, and how it hsould be done. 
* Praxis-based
	- a combination of theory and practice or, more technically, theory-informed practice
### Chapter 1 Biblical-Theological Foundations of Christian Education
* Theology
	- Thoughts about and study of God
* Dallas Willard
	- "We always live up to our beliefs - down to them, as the case may be. Nothing else is possible. It is the nature of belief."
* Theology guides and influences the process an the practice of Christian educators

##### God's Revelation and Christian Education
* General Revelation
	- God's disclosure through his creation and the human conscience
	- Stands as a permanent reminder of God's love and power
	- Spurs and enriches our understanding of God
* Special Revelation
	- When God speaks to us through Jesus Christ and the written Word of God (The Bible)
	- Focus of special revelation is Jesus Christ and through him we are able to know God and have that personal relationship with him.
	- Bible = curriculum
	- Christ = standard for it's interpretation and application
##### The Triune God is the Foundation for Christian Education
* Robert Pazmino
	- Argued that the mutual communion of the persons of the Trinity(perichoresis), in which each divine person is a being for the others, provides the foundational model for Christian education aimed at 'the formation and transformation of persons as beings for others.'" 
##### Defining the Trinity
* Athanasian Creed
	- Establishes that whoever wishes to be saved must believe in the Trinity because it represents a core Christian belief. 
* Pazmiño rightly argues that God the Father, as the Creator of the universe, is the source from whom all Christian education content originates; God the Son, as the Master Teacher, is exemplar or model for authentic Christian teaching; and God the Holy Spirit is the tutor and counselor who sustains the life of the Christian community and the wider society in order to fulfill God’s purposes.

##### The Father as Source
* Gordon Lewis & Bruce Demarest
	- note that in the OT "Father" denotes, "God as the creator, founder of the nation of Israel, and the One who entered into a saving, convenantal relationship with his people."
	- Father "Signifies the new relation of life and live that Christians enjoy with God. The Aramaic term "abba (dear father), is a title of special intimacy found on the lips of a young child."

* Abraham Kuyper
	- "There is not a square inch on the whole plain of human existence over which Christ, who is Lord over all, does not claim: 'This is Mine!'"
##### Content of Jesus's Teaching
* Purpose of Christian teaching
	- not to just impart knowledge, but also leading students into obedience to the Lord.
##### The Three-fold commission 
* To have fellowship with and to worship the sovereign Lord in whose image and likeness we are created
