James,
  I am going to address your second question. I think to really answer this question best we would need to know the age's or maturity of the group you are teaching and writing the curriculum for. I would say that if you were writing a curriculum for K - 5th grade the need for indepth scripture study probably wouldn't be the best way to grab that audiences attention and yes if someone would read that curriculum out of the context for which it was written it would be shallow. But I feel that as the students in Sunday School mature not only in age, but in their walk with God the curriculums and learning approach needs to become more challenging and indepth. I feel what happens though is that as the kids,teens etc grow older they are more and more influenced by the world's culture so many Christian teachers are trying to incorporate more things into the curriculum to hold their attention. Unfortunately, this may and often does cause the teaching to not be as indepth as it should be.

Isaac,

I feel like in today's society trying to find a curriculum that is keeping to the teachings of the Bible and is focusing on the **content** more then the delivery is going to be a bit difficult. As you know student ministry is constantly at competition with what the world IE: youtube,tictok,facebook etc are teaching them 7 days a week 24 hours a day. 
	That being said, I feel the best way to ensure that we are teaching a curriculum that will not only keep the students engaged, but also allow for a more focused content driven instruction we would probably need to start writing those curriculums ourselves.
