## Evaluate Ready-to-Use Lesson Week 2
#### Chad Reynolds
* Theological Soundness: Is the lesson theologically and biblically sound?
	- I believe after reading both the student and teacher versions that the lesson is in fact theologically and biblically sound. Both start out with the actual bible scripture then goes on to elaborate to the meaing of the scripture.
* Age Appropriateness: Is it relevant to the age of the class for which it is written?
	- This lesson was written for students. Not really sure what age group, but reading it I would have to assume 13+ years old. A lot of the questions that were asked to the students in this lesson such as on page 46 in the student handout , "When have you struggled to accept that life can be unfair?" to me points to a question for maturer students middle school and higher. 
* Flexibility: Is it adaptable to different students, churches, and teachers
	- As far as being adaptable I do believe you can adapt this lesson plan for an adult audience, but like I stated above in the age range I don't think you would be able to teach this to anyone younger than 13. A lot of this material really takes the ability to comprehend what Jesus is trying to teach his disciples and the people of the audience. I feel like the engage options listed on page 45 in the teaching handout are a bit to simplified for adults. 
* Implementation: Could you teach it as is? What changes would you make?
	- As I said above one thing I would definitely change if I were going to adapt this lesson for the adults would be the engagement activities. I would try to change them to be something more relavant for adults. Another thing I would probably either change or remove is the devotional found on page 50 in the student handout. While it is a great devotional that should be studied I feel like it doesn't really fit with the message this lesson is trying to teach us That Jesus is our light and he will heal blind eyes from sin so that we can see the righteousness that only He can provide. 
	- As far as being able to teach this as is; yes I don't see any reason why you would not be able to walk into the class and teach this as is. The only thing that may cause a problem is that first engagement activity if you didn't have tape, but I am sure you could find something else to substitute to draw the path.
