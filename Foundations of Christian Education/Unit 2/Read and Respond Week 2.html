<ul>
<li>Indicate something that you learned
<ul>
<li>While there was so much in these pages that I learned the one thing that really stood out to me was  in the section about evaluation and the two ways that people meet evaluating Christian education with resistance. It never would have dawned on me that Christians see evaluating someones curriculum or how a class went would be compared to judging others versus trying to ensure the class is teaching what the objectives state it to teach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share a question that you have from the reading
<ul>
<li>In this chapter it speaks of multi-dimensional education and the responsibilities of the whole church (Body of Christ) to participate in the education of the community. How would the best approach be to address a pastor who feels that the only education the congregation needs is the message that is taught on Sunday?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a connection to the Cardoza reading
<ul>
<li>Like what we read in “Christian Education” by Freddy Cardoza this chapter also emphasizes the importance of keeping the Bible as an integral part of your lesson plan as well as the importance of the entirety being Holy Spirit led.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw applications for your assignments in this class or your current ministry
<ul>
<li>There are many things in this chapter that I am going to use as teaching points and resources to draw upon for when I fully come into the ministry, but the one thing that stood out to me the most was the idea behind thinking of the students as apprentices. This too me and how I learn I feel brings a new side to teaching others about Christianity. Thinking about how Jesus taught his disciples and how they grew in their faith as apprentices under him and let that model shape my teaching structure and methods I feel will really help me in the future.</li>
