<h4>3 Things You Learned:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Differences between classical conditioning and operant conditioning theories</li>
<li>Information Processing Theory and how it pretty much compares a human’s ability to retain information to that of how a computer operates (SR-STM-LTR)</li>
<li>System specific teaching principles and when to use them
<ul>
<li>Behavioral when the people you are teaching are unmotivated or have difficulty behaving</li>
<li>Cognitive when you are teaching curious minds</li>
<li>Affective when you favor personal engagement and the students are self-motivated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2 Quesions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reading through this section there is a lot of emphasis on the learner’s environment. How much of an impact is really effected by where the student is learning versus how they are learning?</li>
<li>You are told last minute that you need to teach a bible study to a completely new group of students. You are handed a pre-written lesson to teach to them. What is the best and most expedient way to assess the learning styles of the group when you first meet them?</li>
</ul>
<h4>1 Application Point:</h4>
<ul>
<li>This section has been crucial for me to be able to properly plan an draft up a lesson plan for teaching others. I definitely can see how the different methods, theories, and principles listed in this section will enable me to craft a thought-provoking and educational lesson plan/bible study in the future.</li>
