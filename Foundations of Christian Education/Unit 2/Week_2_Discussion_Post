## Week 2 Discussion Post
#### 3 Things You Learned:
* Differences between classical conditioning and operant conditioning theories
* Information Processing Theory and how it pretty much compares a human's ability to retain information to that of how a computer operates (SR-STM-LTR)
* System specific teaching principles and when to use them
	- Behavioral when the people you are teaching are unmotivated or have difficulty behaving
	- Cognitive when you are teaching curious minds
	- Affective when you favor personal engagement and the students are self-motivated.
#### 2 Quesions:
* Reading through this section there is a lot of emphasis on the learner's environment. How much of an impact is really effected by where the student is learning versus how they are learning?
* You are told last minute that you need to teach a bible study to a completely new group of students. You are handed a pre-written lesson to teach to them. What is the best and most expedient way to assess the learning styles of the group when you first meet them?
#### 1 Application Point:
* This section has been crucial for me to be able to properly plan an draft up a lesson plan for teaching others. I definitely can see how the different methods, theories, and principles listed in this section will enable me to craft a thought-provoking and educational lesson plan/bible study in the future.
