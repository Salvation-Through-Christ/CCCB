#### Evan,

I would like to address your 2nd question. This is a hard one to really be able to answer in my opinion. To write a lesson plan that is tailored to a mixed group you would need to factor in multiple things. Such as what is the age range of the group you are teaching? Are there learning disabilities in the group that you may need to address? What is your group made up of; college educated people, theologians, elementary students, middle school students? For me this is the reason why you wouldn't really write a lesson plan for a mixed group. There are too many factors that will effect not only the students ability to learn, but also your ability to simplify scripture and still hold true to the text. this is also the reason why I believe most churches break up the groups for weekend church service. You have kids, next gen, then the main congregation of adults. You have to be able to write your lesson aimed at an audience that will understand it without losing authenticity and having "meat on the bone." 

#### Dave,
You asked if the elders and the people who hire pastors would benefit from the 5 elements of leadership. I would have to say a profound yes to that question. I can't think of one situation where the knowledge of the call, character, competence, chemistry, and context wouldn't be things that each pastor needs to have in their being as well as the elders themselves. Elders are established to not only shepherd the flock, but to also be able to protect their flock from false teaching and ensuring the flock stays on the path set before us by God. Without using these 5 elements the elders wouldn't be able to properly assess each new pastor or church staff member they bring on board.
