<h4>Something I learned:</h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the most interesting things I read in the Maddix chapters is actually in the beginning of the text on page 5. I found it pretty interesting and sad reading through the statistics that were listed. Especially the one where 12% of adults think that Joan of Arc was Noah’s wife… (Maddix and Riley 2017)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Question from reading:</h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest questions I have has to do with the mandate on page 8-9. “Christian education – the ministry of teaching – not only responds to the mandate of Jesus to teach, the command of the Great Commission, but also sustains the rationale that it is vital for the faith formation of the believer.”(Maddix and Riley 2017) Many churches that I have attended or watched online seem to say how important it is for us as Christians to go out and make disciples and teach others about Christ and the Gospel, but what I have often encountered is the lack of action compared to the tongue service given towards this mandate. Why do you think a lot of churches preach that they want to focus on discipleship, yet when it comes down to the nitty gritty they don’t want to commit the resources and personnel to that goal?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Connection to Cardoza reading:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because both Maddix and Cardoza are on the subject of Christian education there are a lot of ties and similar teaching between the two texts. But, I have found one in particular which is found on page 12 in the Maddix text that both speak of quite often. “It is not enough to know the Word. Teachers must apply it to their own lives – practice it – before they stand before others and teach it.”(Maddix and Riley 2017) This statement is a very strong and to the point implication to all that want to teach other’s Gods Word. We as teachers need to be the examples to our students of how to live a faithfilled life. We need to be open to our students that even through our struggles we stay faithful and say IN THE WORD.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Application to current ministry or class:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maddix on page 13 mentioned, “When you major in Christian education you’re not majoring in Sunday school, or small groups, or weekly Bible studies; the Bible affirms a wide array of educational opportunities presented for God’s people.”(Maddix and Riley 2017) This is something we all need to take into account when entering into the Christian education field. Many of us me included seem to sometimes bottleneck ourselves to teaching Bible studies, or just teaching youth or Sunday school, but we miss out on all the other teaching opportunities. Opportunities such as apologetics, discipleship leaders, etc. This is something that I myself am going to work on more to open my eyes to all the opportunites that God will put before me in the future.</li>
