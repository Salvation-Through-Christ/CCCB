## Week 3 Discussion Post
#### Chad Reynolds
* 3 Things you Learned:
	- The first interesting thing I learned this week reading the Cardoza text can be found on page 122. Metacognitive Analysis involves helping learners think about how they think. This is pretty interesting and something after reading this I have found I do pretty often. 
	- On page 134 I read about how emotion plays into the learning process and how it is in-fact not the enemy of reason, but helps solidify the information we are learning. I once asked a close friend as to why women seem to never drop a subject or can remember things for an extremely long period of time. She stated to me that it's because women tend to link an emotion to the event or whatever they plan to remember. 
	- I found on page 147 the quote from Leighton Ford to be quite interesting. The fact that leadership always involves change isn't something I would have attributed to leadership. 
* 2 Questions:
	- My first question would have to be on the topic of metacognitive analysis. Is there a "best" way to teach our students how to think about their thinking?  Or is this something that we as teachers need to kind of decifer on our own through our interactions in the class?
	- On page 149 Cardoza wrote about how teachers need to have "values, ethics, convictions, and spiritual maturity;..." Do we have a way or method to be able to "measure" a teachers spiritual maturity? Or is this just something we would have to judge for ourselves as to how strong their knowledge and faith is?
* 1 Application Point:
	- While there are many things from these three chapters that I read I would like to point out the chart on page 148 "Five Key Elements of Leadership". This chart is a great visual that I am going to make a poster for my office. This chart I believe will really help me stay focused on the path I am walking and what I need to improve on or learn to become a successful Christian teacher.
