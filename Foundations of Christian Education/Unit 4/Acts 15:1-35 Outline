## Objective:
* This will demonstrate how Christians approach the subject of false teaching/doctrine and will demonstrate the need for Christians to consistently use discernment and scripture to preach the Gospel to others accurately and when speaking with each other on issues that arrise how to do it with love and humility. 
* James 1:19-20
	- "My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires"
## Introduction (Hook)
* Summarize Chapter 10
	- Acts 10 tells the story of Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his vision from God instructing him to send for Peter. Meanwhile, Peter has a vision where God declares all foods clean, symbolizing that the gospel is for everyone, not just Jews. Peter travels to Cornelius' house, where he preaches about Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit falls on Cornelius and his household, and they are baptized. This event marks a significant moment in the early church, showing that salvation through Jesus is available to Gentiles, not just Jews, breaking cultural and religious barriers.
* Pose question for class to think about during the study
	- Must Gentiles be held to the same Laws of Moses ( specifically circumcision) that the jewish community were  held to in the Old Testiment?
## Body (Book)
* There were Pharisee's (Ones that were "converted") that came from Judea preaching to the gentiles in Antioch.
* Preaching that the gentiles like the jewish had to first uphold the laws of Moses inorder to be saved. (which was a stark contrast to what Paul and Peter has been preaching That being salvation through faith)
* Paul and Barnabus were sent along with others to Jerusalem to inquire about the statements these (false teachers) were proclaiming 
* Verse 10 "Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?"
	- Peter is trying to make the point of why are the "Judiazer's" wanting to make it hard for the newly converted gentiles to bear the same burdens under the law that even the jewish community have not been able to uphold
* Amos 9:11-12
	- "In that day, I will restore David's fallen shelter-- I will repair its broken walls and restore its ruins--and will rebuild it as it used to be, so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name, declares the Lord who will do these things."
* There was an agreement that the gentiles should refrain from eating food that was sacrificed to idols, sexual immorality, the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 
* The council decided that a letter would be drafted to all the gentiles explaining the outcome with a clear message that they would NOT be held to circumcision and the law of Moses, but urged to please respect the Jewish sensitivities such as mentioned above.
## Look 
* After going over this passage how do you now feel about the question I posed in the beginning? Is circumcision a requirement any longer for salvation?
* Do you feel there are churches today that try to add requirements to salvation that aren't in scripture?
### Activity
** Have the students decide which of the topics below are in fact requirements for salvation, or tradition
* List of Church beliefs or practices
	- Baptism

	- Bible translation
	- Music style
		+ instrumental/non-instrumental
	- fasting
	- prayer
	- Evangelism

## Took 
* What does this passage teach us about the Gospel?
* How should Christians handle disagreements over doctrine today? What can we learn from this passage?
* As we conclude ask the students to pray for humility and discernment throughout the week not just for themselves, but for their church and community.
