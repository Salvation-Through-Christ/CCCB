<ul>
<li>Theological Soundness:
<ul>
<li>This lesson didn’t really have true scripture in it. It did contain a paraphrased version of it. So as far as sticking strickly to the scripture passage I would say no, because when paraphrasing the bible a lot of times there tends to be injected the writers own opinions. Also, in this passage there is no where in it where it says that Matthew although a tax collector was a thief like it is stated in the lesson. This statement, “Point out that even though Matthew was a thief and not very nice,…” too me this is a stretch to who Matthew was with no support from scripture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Age Appropriateness:
<ul>
<li>As far as what I found to be not very appropriate was some of the words used in here. The author used the word hated. For this age of the audience this is directed to I feel like a tamer word could have been used. Other then that the activities provided does point towards the K-5th grade level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flexibility:
<ul>
<li>The way this lesson is tailored towards the K-5th grade level I don’t feel like this is a lesson that could be taught to anyone older. You would have to make some drastic changes to the content and the activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation:
<ul>
<li>Yes, you can walk into class with this lesson plan and be able to teach as is. The only things I would change would be some of the word choices as well as the injection of opinions that aren’t backed by scripture.</li>
</ul>
