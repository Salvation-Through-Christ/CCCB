#### James,
I like how you asked one of the questions that are usually the elephant in the room. Your first question is pretty key to not only growing a successful church, but also allows the volunteers that give up their free time to volunteer a sense of belonging. When churches properly spend the time to train their volunteers it shows to the volunteers that they are infact a key component to the area they are serving in as well as the church as a whole. For my church here at New Day they have a couple things they are doing to train their volunteers. Our worship and production teams in which I serve on as a Front of House audio technician provides workshops that are put together by the staff and volunteers that maybe SME's in that field as well as provide us access to online training such as MXU.

#### Isaac,
I read a book recently about what biblical eldership is and in there it couldn't stress enough the importance of making sure to not just dive in and rush to elect elders. I would hope to think this same principle would apply to selecting a disciplship team or a teaching ministry. I believe the best way to ensure someone is ready to teach or disciple others would be by speaking to that person, observing how their character is and making that judgment on how mature in the faith that they are. This is something that shouldn't be an "overnight" process, but  something that is devoted a lot of time to put together and to pray on.
