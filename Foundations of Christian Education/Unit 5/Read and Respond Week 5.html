<ul>
<li>Something I learned:
<ul>
<li>One interesting thing I learned in this reading was about the three curriculum’s found on page 154 figure 16.1. I had no idea about the “null” curriculum. And when thinking on the example he gave about what the hidden curriculum it makes a lot of sense. You tend to learn so much that you don’t realize while still learning what is being taught.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question:
<ul>
<li>Is there anyway to actively practice the null curriculum conscienceless or is that strictly something that the students will learn on their own?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection to Cardoza:
<ul>
<li>Like most of these books they do have a lot of similarities between them, but one thing I have observed in reading this chapter in Maddix like Cardoza’s text is it’s focus on stressing the importance of the curriculum and why at times it may seem pointless or boring, but in-fact is crucial if we are to have students learn what we are teaching in a intellectually engaging way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application:
<ul>
<li>After reading Maddix I will keep in focus the point of the audience and what the objectives and purpose that I am trying to teach them when moving forward in my lesson plan writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Robbe, “Purchasing Ready-to-Use Curriculum”</h3>
<ul>
<li>Something I learned:
<ul>
<li>One of the things I learned while reading Robbe is found on page 303. He gives us a breakdown of the seven characteristics of a good curriculum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question:
<ul>
<li>While I see the benefits of using a ready-to-use lesson plan I feel it can also be a hindrance. Wouldn’t the time put into going over the lesson plan by the educator to ensure it aligns with the beliefs and theology that the particular church is trying to teach it’s congregation take just as long?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection to Cardoza:
<ul>
<li>Again because of the subject matter this is very similar to what we are reading in Cardoza’s text. Strong focus on curriculum, but does put more emphasis on ready to learn lesson plans and their benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application:
<ul>
<li>Like I said above while I can grasp the pro’s for this “learner’s guide” that this paper is trying to advertise and support I still find rolling up ones sleeve and writing a lesson plan yourself would better benefit your audience. The only real applications I would see for something like this is for bible studies that are focusing on a book such as the Wild at Heart study that many men’s groups study.</li>
</ul>
