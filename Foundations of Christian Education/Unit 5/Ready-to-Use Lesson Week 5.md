## Ready-to-Use Lesson Week 5
#### Chad Reynolds
* Theological Soundness:
	- As far as the theological accuracy of this lesson I feel it is right on the money. Holding true to the scripture text. I read the passage first and then read both pdf lessons and didn't find anything out of sorts. 
* Age Appropriateness:
	- Both the teacher's section and the students handout were well tailored to the intended age for this study. I really like in particular the sidebar found on the student handout that gives the students the "life lessons" that can be found in this passage.
* Flexibility:
	- This lesson can be easily adapted to fit various settings and age groups. Even the activities provided can be used for various ages and demographics. 
* Implementation:
	- Very well done on this section. Not only does the study provide the teacher with multiple activities, but it also gives the students something tangible to bring home with them and read over and think about throughout the week.
