## Week 5 Discussion Post
#### Chad Reynolds
* 3 Thrings you learned:
	- First thing I learned is found on page 212. It's the difference between theory and praxis. Theory is the study of God's Word and praxis is how to put what you learn in theory into action.
	- On page 216 I learned the differences between the structural and functional family ministries.
	- The third thing I learned is the importance of informal learning and the role it plays in instilling the love and obedience to God.
* 2 Questions:
	- From my recollection of the teir of importance and I am not sure if I am bringing in my western cultural views into this, but isn't the path of importance God, family, church? It seems like these chapters are imphasizing the church community over the influences of the immediate family (Mother and father). 
	- On page 229 the author talks about the School Model. Stating, "In this approach, the focus of teaching is building knowledge rather than facilitating an encounter with Christ." We are not born with immediate knowledge of God and His rules. This is something that we have to be taught from our parents and through the church. So, wouldn't the school approach facilitate the knowledge needed for someone to properly accept Christ and to follow His path?
* 1 Application:
	- The  lessons learned in these chapters can be used in all aspects of ministry and evangelism, but I would say that using the models presented to us on pages 233-236 will allow us to better tailor the lessons we create to better reach each stage of development.
