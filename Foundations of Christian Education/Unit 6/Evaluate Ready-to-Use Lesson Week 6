#### Evaluate Ready-to-Use Lesson Week 6
* Theological Soundness:
	- While this lesson is one that is tailored to 1st and 2nd grade students I feel like it left out a lot of supporting information. For example, in this study it gave the only reason why Joseph's brothers hated him was because of the coat. We know from this passage that the coat was not the only reason, but also because of the visions that were given to him in his dreams. Also the sections it spoke about how God had warned Joseph about the famine could have used more supportive information. The reason Joseph went to God was because Pharoah had a dream that needed to be interpretted. 
* Age Appropriateness:
	- I feel the lesson and the activities provided are all appropriate for the age group it is meant to teach.
* Flexibility:
	- I feel like any bible study is adapatable to any age group/church/school with the proper changes. This bible study being written for 1st and 2nd graders would need further details added and a more indepth study of the passage to be able to be adapted to other age groups. 
* Implementation:
	- Yes, this bible study could be taught as is to the age group intended. The changes I would make concern it's depth of information provided. I would most definitely add all the reasons for the brothers hatred toward Joseph as well as show more of a detailed account of the trials that Joseph faced prior to working with Pharoah.
