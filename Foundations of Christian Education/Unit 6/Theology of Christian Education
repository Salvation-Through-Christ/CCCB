### Theology of Christian Education
* Because God is...
	- Love
		+ I teach with the love God expects from His creation.
		+ Scripture Passage
			* Romans 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
	- Truth
		+ I teach with the truth provided to me in scripture. I teach others about how we receive absolute truth from God's Word.
		+ Scripture Passage
			* John 17:17 "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."
	- Wisdom
		+ I teach with the wisdom that the bible teaches. Not only the wisdom from God himself, but from the wisdom of all those who have come before us teaching His word
		+ Scripture Passage
			* James 1:5 "But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
* Because humans are...
	- Created in God's image
		+ I teach my fellow Christians and non-Christians wiith the respect and reverance that is due each human being. We all are created in God's image and because of that we all deserve the respect, love, and grace to find our way closer to our creator
		+ Scripture
			* Genesis 1:26-27 "Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." 27 God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."
	- Fallible
		+ I teach with empathy and understanding that we as humans will never be perfect while on earth. I will teach with patience and understanding that some may fall away, but with patience and consistency they can be brought back to Christ. 
		+ Scripture 
			* Romans 3:23 "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
	- Different 
		+ Because each person is different in their own ways with their own ways of learning and understanding I will learn myself how to better reach each individual on their level. I will keep in mind that no matter how different a person maybe they are all reachable with the correct engagement. 
* Because the Bible talks about education in these ways...
	- Importance
		+ The Bible stresses the importance that God's Word be used to teach others. And because of this I feel educating others about God and His kingdom is one of the most important aspects that we as followers of Christ can do.
		+ Scripture
			* Psalm 119:66 "Teach me good discernment and knowledge, For I believe in Your commandments."
	- As the means to create disciples
		+ I teach not just Christians, but non-Christians as well. 
		* Scripture
			- Matthew 28:16-20, we are to go forth and make disciples who make disicples. The best way to do this is to teach others about Christ.
