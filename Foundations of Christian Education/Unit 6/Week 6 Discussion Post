### Week 6 Discussion Post
* 3 Things You Learned:
	- On page 253 I learned what MTD is and it's effect on emerging adults.
	-  As we read on page 264 we as Christians educators should focus on guiding adults towards a relationship with God.
	-  On page 283 Wilhoit gives us the three sets of images; nurture, journey, and death and resurrection.
* 2 Questions:
	- Wouldn't the teaching of Christian education done right facilitate spiritual formation?
	- On page 253 the book speaks about MTD. In reality though is it truly MTD or the failure of the church to stay connected to it's younger adults that cause them to not come back for years?
	- Do we as educators spend too much time trying to put people into specific groups instead of just teaching God's message?
* 1 Application:
	- Reading through these chapters it has become clear that with the introduction of social media and the further inclusion of tech we need to adapt our teaching styles for the younger adults and maturer adults accordingly. While I agree that there has to be some changes, I also feel we still need to remain true to scripture. Remember Jesus started out teaching 12 disciples and was able to do that with no technology.
