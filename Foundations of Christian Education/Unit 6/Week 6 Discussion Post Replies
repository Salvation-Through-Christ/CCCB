## Week 6 Discussion Post Replies
Isaac,

In response to your 2nd question I think we need to instill that desire for our older more mature Christians to pick up the reigns and mentor the younger generation. We need to remind the maturer ones that their opportunities and experiences throughout their lives molded them into the ability to pass down that knowlege to the younger generation. 

I feel like in today's culture there seems to be a divide between the old generation and the younger ones. The older generation wants things to stay the way it was while they were growing up and the younger generation just can't engage with that. We need to learn to close that gap between the two generations. 

Eddie,

Honestly in response to your second question I don't feel there is any balance. Anyone who changes their opinion especially about scripture based on emotions isn't someone you want leading a congregation. The Bible is the word of God. If you are changing opinions and teaching others from your opinions you are then saying God's Word isn't true for today's culture. I feel this is how a lot of churches in today's culture are starting to stray. Remember emotions are mainly drawn from the heart. Jeremiah says it very well in Jeremiah 7:24, "Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in [their own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward."(Multi-Verse Retrieval 2020)
