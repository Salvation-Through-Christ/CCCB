### Evaluate Ready-to-Use Lesson Week 7
* Theological Soundness:
	- Because this lesson was written for a preschool age I feel theologically and biblically this is a very good lesson for that age group. It lays out the story of Joseph is a very well chain of events that this age group would be able to stay engaged and understand.
* Age Appropriateness:
	- Like I mentioned above this lesson was very well written for a preschool aged audience. No only does it tell the story of Joseph well, but also has spots in it to keep the audience visually engaged. 
* Flexibility:
	- In the beginning of the lesson pack it does state that it is able to be modified for other age groups or audiences. But, I feel that to do so would entail changing so much of it that it would be better to just create a new bible study on Joseph and the events that occurred.
* Implementation:
	- Honestly, I don't see anything in this plan that needs to be changed. Not only does it have some fantastic activities and craft ideas, but in the beginning of the pack it gives you access to other online resources that provides more activities and discussions that aren't in the packet alone. Nothing in this lesson I feel is missing or would prevent me from being able to walk into a preschool sunday school class and teach it as is.
