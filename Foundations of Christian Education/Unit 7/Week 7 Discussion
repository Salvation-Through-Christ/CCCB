### Week 7 Discussion
* 3 Things I learned:
	- On page 292 it spoke about how teachers/ministry leaders need to stay current with the environments they teach in as well as the ever changing technology and worldly changes that are occurring. 
	- On page 294 I learned about the impact that is incurred when people move out of rural areas and into a more city environment. I found the statement about cities having more of a secularizing impact.
	- Page 304 gave me a better understanding of what a parachurch actually is. 
* 2 Questions:
	- My first question is concerning the issue with secularization in cities. Do we feel that churches that are located in rural areas should teach and prepare the younger congregations for the things to expect if they move into larger more secular areas?
	- Concerning parachurches do we need to try and focus more on this type of ministry to really reach the world?
* 1 Application:
	- One of the biggest applications for ministry and discipleship that I have found useful in the text was the importance of learning the setting and environments that you are ministering to. As well as being able to stay up to date on current technology and the secular views and opinions that surround the location where you are. Doing so will help you reach the next generation more effectively for evangelizing.
