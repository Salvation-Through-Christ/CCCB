### Evaluate Ready-to-Use Lesson Week 8
* Theological Soundness:
	- This lesson was based on a book to be ready by the bible study group. So from the few scripture passages that Max Lucado references everything does appear to be biblically sound.
* Age Appropriateness:
	- This lesson is a hard one for people to grasp. This is definitely a lesson for a more mature Christian then for the younger school aged Christians. Max did a great job keeping it tailored towards the adult demographic.
* Flexibility:
	- Because of the subject matter I do feel this would not be appropriate yet for elementary thru middle school aged children. I do feel though that this could be tailored towards high school age and adults. This lesson can be taught in multiple churches, bible study groups and don't see any issue with teachers being able to lead this study.
* Implementation:
	- This was a well written and through bible study lesson. It really makes the student dig deep and confront their issues with fear and the forgiveness of sins. Even myself struggle trying to fully comprehend the magnitude of what it means to be forgiven by God.
