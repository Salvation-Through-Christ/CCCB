<ul>
<li>What I learned:
<ul>
<li>One of the more interesting things reading through the text I learned is from the quote found on page 152. As we all mature in Christ and in our faith we find ourselves sometimes taking for granted the importance to stay in God’s Word. Not only does it enable us to learn from God, but also protects us all through discernment to call out and identify false teachers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question from reading:
<ul>
<li>I found the statement found on page 150 to be a little misleading. From the statement, “Understanding of his word is <em>purchased</em> only at the price of faithful study and diligent application.“Is this author trying to say we purchase our salvation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection to Cardoza:
<ul>
<li>Like the text and reading of the Cardoza book this text stresses the importance of staying true to scripture and the constant study of God’s Word not only to learn from God, but to be able to strengthen ourselves against all those that would lead us astray.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application:
<ul>
<li>The applicable information provided in this reading is that we need to focus our energy as ministers/preachers to teach and lead the flock we are given by God to lead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
