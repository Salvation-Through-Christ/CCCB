BOT 361 Old Testament Prophets

Word Count:

Why do you think we have so few sermons or Bible studies on the prophets in spite of the fact that 1/6 of the Bible is a prophetic book?

	I feel the prophetic books in the bible don't get enough recognition for what they are and because of how they are written are sometimes hard to read through and fully comprehend. Also when writing sermons and bible studies these days most people want to focus on the story of Jesus and salvation so mainly they are preaching and doing studies in the new testament instead of the old testament. I have spoken a lot of times to other pastors and people in ministry about why the old testament as a whole doesn't really get studied that much in a lot of churches and unfortunately the answer I usually get is that because of the new testament it doesn't really apply that much after Jesus' resurrection and our new covenant we are under. I honestly feel that this is wrong. The old testament tells us so much about how we began and where we came from that I feel it needs to be studied a lot more.
