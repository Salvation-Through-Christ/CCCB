Introduction to Prophets
	- Why study the prophets?
		- Jesus studied them and quotes them
		- Because God has revealed some of who HE is to them
		- They are fascinating, dramatic, human, and heroic
		- Some of the problems they faced, we face
		- The NT writers quoted the Prophetic books
		- Your understanding of Christianity grows / how these guys fit into God's plan for salvation
	- Facts
		- Goal of the OT is the Messiah and His Kingdom (not that the Messiah is in every passage)
		- Prophecy comes from the Prophet's circumstances (News of that day)
		- Prophecy is expressed in the language of the prophet's time
		- Prophecy bears the character and the learning of the prophet
		- Time element in prophecy is usually indefinite (Mountain top perspective)
		- The more distant the time of events prophesied the more general in nature
		- Note prophecy can be conditional.
		- Even though prophecy foretold events, it also met the needs of the time
		- Prophesied doom, exile, return, reconstruction were fulfilled in the return from Babylon
		- Other cultures have prophecy, but Hebrew prophecy is unique in it's authority and accuracy
	- Who is a prophet
		- An individual who acts as a spokesman for God
		- An individual who receives revelation from God
	- Names for prophets
		- Ro'eh "a seeing one" one who has visions (often called a seer)
		- Ish elohim "a man of God"
		- Nabi usual word for "prophet". Simply an inspired spokesman
		- Other terms - watchman, mouthpiece, etc.
	- Prophetic Behavior
		- Often times did unusual things Ezekiel laid on his side, Jeremiah buried some underwear, Isaiah ran around without clothes
		- Ecstatic behavior? This was common among prophets of other nations, but somewhat rare among prophets of the LORD (Saul) "Most prophets were sober in nature (kind of resistant)"
		- yet, there was a compulsion upon them by God to speak and do things
	- True vs False Prophet
		- The prophetic tests from (Deuteronomy 13:3-5 and 18:20-22)
			- If performed a miracle and then advocated other gods, he was false.
			- If simply counseled rebellion against the LORD (as Balaam) then false
			- Was not correct 100% of the time when speaking from the LORD
	- Prophecy and Fulfillment
		- Many prophecies are conditional, but not all
		- Most common are predictive prophecies about some future event
			- Single fulfillment prophecies 
			- Multiple fulfillment (highly debated) IE: Daniel's Abomination of Desolation may be one
		- The other major type is that of typology
