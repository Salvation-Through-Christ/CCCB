Darr,
	I think your post was very well written and researched. The only thing on there that may be a bit questioning is your take on sin passing from Adam's seed. This is pointing strongly towards original sin. In the Cathlic world this is accepted and that is one of the reasons why they support infant baptisms, but remember the bible states in Acts 2:38 "Peter said to them, 'Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'" The reason why as Christians we don't believe in infant baptism is because we don't believe you are born into original sin. And in order to properly repent of the sins you have commited you hav.e to be at the age of accountability to do so. You are also spot on about what salvation is in your third paragraph. We all need to make sure we realize and teach that our salvation is a gift GIVEN to us by God and there is nothing we can do to earn it 

Byron, 
	Very well stated. Also with the fact that Christ came from Mary alone we are presented with another prophecy perhaps the very first of them from God back in Genesis 3:15, "And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel." We all know that it takes two to tango, but here it specifically states HER SEED. Which we know turns out to be Christ and He did infact defeat Satan (death). No other way could Christ be able to do this unless He himself was sinless and born through the miraculous virgin birth.
