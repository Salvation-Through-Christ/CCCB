Introduction to Isaiah
    Isaiah the Man
        - Ministered for 60 years
        - Married to "the prophetess" and had atleast 2 kids
        - Perhaps related to royalty
        - Considered by some as the 5th evangelist
    Isaiah and the Cannon
        - 1st of the Major Prophets in English
        - 1st of the Latter Prophets in Hebrew
        - Considered Scripture by Josephus, Qumran, and by the 80 quotations in the NT
        - Second most quoted book in the NT(Behind Psalms)
        - Isaiah has 39 chapters of judgment and 27 of hope, though this is a bit of overgeneralization
    Date of Isaiah
        - Begins his ministry in the year of Uzziah's death (740 BC)
        - Dies sometime after 681 BC during the reign of Manasseh
        - Sees the Syro-Ephraimite war, the Northern kingdom's fall, the invasion of Sennacherib (701 BC), and the descent of Judah into Manasseh's depravity
    Multiple Authorship of Isaiah
        - It was first doubted that Isaiah composed the entire book by Ibn Ezra (1092-1167)
        - Johannes Doederlein in 1789 discovered "Deutero-Isaiah"
        - It is now believed that at least 3 people wrote Isaiah(Bernard Duhm's view)
            * Isaiah (1-39)
            * Deutero-Isaiah (40-55)
            * Trito-Isaiah (56-66)
        - Presuppositions
            - All prophecy is ex eventu (after the fact)
            - Different subject matter in Isaiah 1-39 and 40-66 necessitate different authors (changing focus from Assyria to Babylon for example)
            - Different styles of writing between the different chapters
        - A unifed Isaiah
            - No division in Qumran manuscripts of Isaiah
            - No LXX division. Aramaic Targums don't divide It
            - NT quotes or alludes to material from all three supposed Isaiah's and simply calls it Isaiah
            - See John 12:38-41
            - Witness of Ben Sirach
            - Witness of Jeremiah 30:10-11
            - Most important is the contemporary of Isaiah, Micah
            - The use of Isaiah's title for God "Holy One of Israel" throughout
            - The flora and fauna issue. (Deutero-Isaiah originally thought written from Babylon)
            - Modern Approach
                - R. Clements article "the Unity of Isaiah" suggested 4 major pieces, but one redactor who assembled them into the book of Isaiah
                - Each of these pieces was influenced by the earlier pieces (hence similar vocabulary. this is called intertextuality)
                - Most consider the 2nd Isaiah to be the core part and that the rest of the book was constructed around it.
