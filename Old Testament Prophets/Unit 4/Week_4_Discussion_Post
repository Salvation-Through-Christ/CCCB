Discussion Post Week 4

This is a picture of the "siege of Lachish" from Sennacherib's palace (Isaiah 36, 37). In your mind what benefit is archaeology to biblical studies and what limitations does it have?

  The benefits of archaeology in not just biblical studies, but to mankind as a whole is that it provides authenticity and something tangible for us to grasp. Because we as humans are a very tangible and hands on beings archaeology helps reinforce and support the events that we read in the Bible. Everyone has heard throughout their lives the phrase "Seeing is believing". This couldn't fit more perfectly to how we as humans learn and accept things we experience throughout our lives. Unfortunately this is also an excuse when it comes with skeptics about religion. They can't comprehend the idea of faith because a lot of what we believe as Christians isn't something we can reach out and touch.
  The biggest limitation to archaeology in my view is how the archaeological finds are interpretted and studied by mankind and the fact that no matter who you are our personal biases will always effect that process. 


Darr,
  I really like what you wrote about how we need to use the Bible as the reliable text to verify the finds at archaeological sites. To many times I feel like archaeology scientists tend to allow their biases bleed into how they interpret what they have found.
