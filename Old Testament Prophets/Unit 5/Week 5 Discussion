Week 5 Discussion

How would you respond to either a Jewish person or an unbeliever to the claim that the Suffering Servant in Isaiah 42, 49, 50, and 52/53 is the nation Israel rather than Jesus?

  One main point I would make in support of the suffering servant being about Jesus and not Israel would have to do with the verb usage in chapter 53. The verb usage in Isaiah 53 is in the past tense. For example,"Who has BELIEVED our message? And to whom HAS the arm of the LORD been revealed?" Just in the first two verses of chapter 53 you can read it is speaking of someone looking back at the events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

Byron,
  I love the passages you used. The fact we can now look back on the prophecies and see how many of them have come true really is a fantastic way to prove the authenticity and reliability of the Bible and the the TRUTH it contains. I have one question for you though. If you were speaking with a Jewish person how would you go about convincing them that anything in the New Testament can be found reliable since they still don't acknowledge the New Tesatment?

Megan,
  I do agree with you about the suffering servant being a prophecy of Jesus Christ. Throughout the Old Testemant God has tried to get it through our thick skulls that He is going to be sending a Messiah to save us all,but it seems we keep ignoring all the signs. Isaiah 53 to me is the most nail on the head in your face statement by God that Jesus Christ would be coming to save us.
