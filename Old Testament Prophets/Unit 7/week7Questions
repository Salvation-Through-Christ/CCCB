Week 7 Questions over Reading

1. Do you think God placed special oversight over Daniel and the others?

2. In these prophetic books i see a lot about people getting revelations through dreams. As I understand it in Islam belief this is how they receive instruction from God is through dreams. Is that because of the OT dream revelations that so many of these prophet's experienced?

3. Do you think King Neb has some belief in God? Or did he just see Him as one of many gods?

4. Do you think when Daniel is speaking of the peoples will mix with one another in verse 2:43 that he is speaking about Rome and the Jew's?

5. Do any commentators think that the events in chapter 4 concerning King Neb and how fast he forgot about God after receiving that revelation from Daniel could be making a similarity to the Israelites after the Exodus who kept forgetting God as well?
