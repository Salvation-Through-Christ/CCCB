Daniel Chapters 1-6 and Introduction

Introduction
	* Daniel's Place in Canon
  		* In the English (and LXX) Daniel is the 5th book in the Major Prophets
		* In the Hebrew bible Daniel is placed in the "Ketubim" or Writings
	* Why isn't Daniel in writings?
  		* Lack of the Oracle formula, "Thus saith the Lord"
		* Lack of prophetic ties to Kings (following Noth's idea of a Deuteronomistic history and the prophet's dependance on it)
		* A possible late composition of Daniel would place it the scripture that was accepted last i.e. the Writings.
		* Christian use of Daniel may have prompted Jewish interpreters towards Daniel
	* Evidence of Daniel as a prophet
  		* Jesus refers to a quotation from Daniel as being "from the prophet" (Matthew 24:15)
		* Five pieces of Daniel found at Qumran have commentaries on Daniel the prophet.
		* The LXX arrangement
		* Some Syriac fragments place Daniel among the prophets
	* Is Daniel a prophet?
		* No place in the book refers to Daniel as a prophet
		* It may be best to say that Daniel had the prophetic gift, but not the prophetic office. Is this a proper distinction?
		* Daniel it seems is a godly steward in the Lord's service.
	* Daniel and Joseph
		* Both interpreted dreams
		* Both imprisoned unjustly
		* Both served as statesman in foreign courts
		* Both predicted the future via dreams (Joseph's famine and Daniels tumbling empires)
	* Date of Daniel
		* the traditional and in my opinion correct, view is the 6th century B.C. in a Neo-Babylonian/Persian context
			* Reasons for 6th century dates
				* Existence of Daniel in LXX seems to indicate a pre 300 B.C. writing
				* 1 Maccabees 2:59-60 has Matthias (founder of the Maccabees) quoting Daniel as if it had existed for a while.
				* Josephus statements
					* Scripture settled by reign of Artaxerxes I (456 B.C.) which includes Daniel
					* Alexander the Great (333 B.C.) writers supposedly shown parts of Daniel
				* Ezekiel (a writer who lived in Babylon) mentions Daniel (14:14, 28:3) who would have been well known to his readers.
				* Daniel's use of the term "Shinar" for Babylon is not attested in the 2nd century, bt well used in the 6th century.
		* Some conservatives and most liberals date Daniel to the 2nd century B.C. in a Maccabean Revolt context.
			* Reasons for 2nd century date
				* Assumption of no predictive prophecy. All prophecy is ex vaticum ex eventu
				* Location in writings instead of prophets
				* Porphry's statements (A.D. 233-234)
				* Apocalyptic literature common in 2nd century
				* Aramaic seems to fit a 2nd century context
				* Use of Greek terms in text. (Suggested that the Greek language was prevalent)
				* Varius historical mistakes
				* Arguments from silence
			* Answers to the 2nd century dating
				* Predictive prophecy is possible
				* Dating has nothing to do with location in Sacred Writings (example Job)
				* Porphyry's statement is from a pagan and baised
				* Apocalyptic literature is known in the 6th century.
				* More recent studies show Aramaic of Daniel better fits 6th century
				* 3 Greek terms are musical instruments
				* Historical errors are being proven not errors
				* Arguments from silence are logical fallacies
	* Historical questions
		* Nebuchadnessar's defeat of Jehoiakim in the third year of the latter's reign. (Jeremiah 25:1 says the fourth year)
		* Belshazzar as last king of Babylon, when historians have Nabonidus
		* Identity of Darius the Mede
		* Use of the term "Chaldean"
		Nebuchadnezzar's or was it Nabanitus illness?
	* Language of Daniel
		* Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew from 1:1-2:4a and 8-12. Aramaic from 2:4b - 7:28.
		* Several loan words from Persian (of a type only used before 300 B.C.) and a few Greek.
		* The Aramaic betrays an Akkadian syntax showing a Mesopotamian, not Philitinian origin.
	* Additions to Daniel
		* Song of the Three Holy Children
		* Susanna
		* Bel and the Dragon
		* The Prayer of Nabonidus (Not truly an addition, but found at Qumran. It has some parallels to Daniel)
	* Historical backdrop
		* Babylon (605-539)
		* Persia (539-331)
		* Greece (331 - 146)
		* Rome (63 B.C. - 70 A.D.)
	* Organization of Daniel
		* The Hebrew, Aramaic, Hebrew may show a classic ABA pattern
		* The Aramaic section (Daniel 2-7) works well into a chiastic structure
	* Outlines
		* Some commentators like a 3 part outline
		* Prologue (Chapter 1)
		* Personal Stories (2-6)
		* Visions (7-12)
Chapter 1-6
