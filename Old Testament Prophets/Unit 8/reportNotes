Interpretations of Joel 2:28-32

The Promise of the Spirit
“It will come about after this
That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;
And your sons and daughters will prophesy,
Your old men will dream dreams,
Your young men will see visions.
“Even on the male and female servants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days.

The Day of the Lord
“I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,
Blood, fire and columns of smoke.
“The sun will be turned into darkness
And the moon into blood
Before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.
“And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the Lord
Will be delivered;
For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
There will be those who escape,
As the Lord has said,
Even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.

* We are told:
  * How the kingdom of Grace will be bestowed upon us by the effusion of the Spirit
  * Peter mentions this passage on Pentecost (The gift of the Holy Spirit)
    *  In the OT we were introduced to a "sprinkling" of the Holy Spirit upon God's prophets and chosen ones, but now this is stating the Holy Spirit will be bestowed upon all whom believe.
  * This is referring to Jew and Gentile alike (IE: Cornelius)
  * Also servants and slaves alike
  * The gifts that they would receive would allow them to build the church, write scripture etc.
* In Mount Zion and Jerusalem they will be deliverance from the terror of the end days
* This is also a foundation of comfort and hope to sinners that whatever danger there is in their case there is also deliverance.
* "There will be those who escape"
  * There will not be many :(

* Verse 28 suggests that spiritual renewal will follow the judgment and physical restoration
* This will come about after the judgment of Judah where they get invaded by Babylon (Gentile Nation)
  * "Jeremiah 29:11"
* "That I will pour out my spirit on all mankind"
  ** This not only applies to Israel but to Gentiles 
* The fact that God included the male and female servants shows that God cares for all His creation 
* This was quoted by Peter in his sermon on Pentecost
* Because Peter didn't claim the prophecy was fulfilled it eludes to the fact Pentecost began the fullfillment, but there are still more apsects that need to be fullfilled which will happen at the end of times.
* "Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions"
  * "The visions that both Peter and Cornelius saw that brought them together"
  * "Pauls vision that rerouted him from Asia to Macedonia"
  * This passage seems to elude to the fact that the increase of visions and prophecy will yet again rise during the end times.
* "I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth"
  * "This was partly fulfilled at the time of Jesus' crucifixion with the earthquakes and the supernatural darkness"
* "In those days there will be blood, fire, and columns of smoke"
  * Horrors of war 
  * These wonders suggest a crisis on earth and precede God's judgment on all disobedient people. 
* "The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood"
  * Solar and Luna eclipses?
  * Could also mean that the sun and moon are affected by the great wars on earth 
* "These wonders will take place before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes."
  * this refers to the time that the LORD will reveal His supreme power and authority over human power and human existence
* "And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD  will be delivered"
  * proves that even in the end of times God's grace is still available to all those who call on His name 

Dehoff's commentary
  * Vs. 28
    * This is the fortelling of the day of Pentecost where the Holy Spirit would be poured out on all the believers.
    * The HIGH point the beginning of the New Testament church, beginning of baptism into Christ
  * Vs. 30
    * Matthew 24:29
      * Referenced when the Jewish religion would be destroyed and the Christian relgion would be established
  * Vs. 32
    * This references the Christian disipensation and the preaching of the Gospel
    * All who obey the LORD will be saved.

Matthew Henry's commentary
  * The Jewish community beleived that the reference to the pouring out of the Holy Spirit to all flesh only meant the Israelistes, but God is telling them it is for all Jew and Gentile alike.
  * This will allow new discoveries of new things. (Prophecing, tongues etc.)
  * The kingdom of glory will be introduced by the universal change in nature.
  * Vs 30-31
    * Many believe this part of the prophecy will not be fulfilled until the end of times, but others believe it has been partially fulfilled in the events following Jesus' death.
    * Also referencing the destruction of Jerusalem.
  * Vs 32
    * Promise for deliverance to all who reach out to God. Even during end of days.

The Wesleyan Bible commentary
  * 2 main promises 
    * Pour out spirit to all flesh
    * whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered
  * 2 phases
    * The Blessing Phase
    *  vs 28,29
    * The Cataclysmic Phase
    * vs 30,31
