Interviewing & Loss Lecture
	- Initial Interview
		- Do informed consent prior to doing the interview (Why you do what you do and how. Confidentiality)
		- Interview
			- This refers to the first initial meeting with a client, which could potentially take place over the phone when collecting information regarding the referral
		- Tasks of the Interview
			- Develop relationship
				- In the counseling world, this is referred to as building "rapport"
				- This is essential. If a client does not build trust with you, they are unlikely to feel comfortable enough to explore the issues they need to on a deeper level.
			- Gather information
				- This would be the time to gather more factual information and ask closed ended questions to understand the history and background of the client.
			- Determine current functioning and capacity to function
				- Mental Status Exam
					- Includes basic details such as appearance, affect,mood,ability to communicate, behavior,memory,visual/auditory hallucinations,and orientation to time and place
					- Doctors and psychiatrists will make document observations regarding mental status for every visit to assess functioning
			- Determine if the helper can counsel the client
				- This is to be assessed in an unbiased manner
					- Do you have the proper training to provide counsel?
					- Will your beliefs conflict with the goals of the client?
			- Determine the client's goals for counseling
				- Illustration: If they buy a ticket to fly to Los Angeles, the airport is obligated to take them to Los Angeles... not North Dakota.
					- It is important to set aside your own ambitions for your clients and focus on their personal goals
						- It may be that the client would benefit from some resolution of past trauma, but the only reason they sought counsel was to develop skills to communicate better with their spouse. As counselors, we have to respect this and focus on the goals they present.
			- Make predictions and/or diagnosis
				- Many providers are required to provide a diagnosis as early on as possible so that insurance will justify the payment of service.
				- It would be better practice to provide at least a few sessions of counsel before an official diagnosis is made because an individual may present differently over time.
				- Diagnosis should serve as a guide to help you address your treatment based upon evidence-based interventions
					- Be aware of the diagnsis that you give because some can follow people around their whole lives
		- Styles of Interview
			- Structured
				- Ask a specific set of questions
				- Primarily led by the therapist
			- Unstructured
				- No specific questions or guidelines to follow
				- Primarily let by the client
		- The Loss Timeline
			- One way to approach the interview and gather more detailed information regarding the client's life and situation
				- Provides an understanding fo real and perceived losses
				- Highlights strengths and assets
				- Helps clients build confidence in their abilities to overcome current events given how they have addressed previous life stressors.
				- Highlights unresolved issues from the past that may be contributing to the current stressor
		- Kubler-Ross Model
			- Characterized by five stages of reactions and responses people experience as a result of loss
				- Stage 1:  Denial and Isolation
					- Healthy and normal experience that serves to function as a buffer when hearing unexpected and/or shocking news.
				- Stage 2: Anger
					- Characterized by a "Why me" pattern: it's an attempt to gain some sense of control admidst that which is out of control.
					- May begin to exhibit hostility and resentment which may be directed toward other people, the world, or God.
				- Stage 3: Bargaining
					- People begin to attempt to bargain with physicians or God to extend life for another chance or to accomplish something.
				-  Stage 4: Depression
					- Once people behin to admit the reality of the situation
				- Stage 5: Acceptance
					- Characterized by quiet, peaceful resignation; the end of the mourning over the loss
		- Areas of counseling that will likely be seen throughout your practice as a helper
			- Death & Loss
				- As discussed thus far, grief is a difficult process. As a helper, focus on helping the client:
					- Bridge the past
					- Live in the present
					- Find a new path
				- Pertinent skills for helping the bereaved
					- Begin where the bereaved person is
					- Clarify his/her feelings
					- Empathize
					- Be sensative to personal feelings
					- Don't use faulty reassurances
			- Stress & Anxiety
				- Help the client put thoughts, situations, and experiences into perspective
				- Ask and help the client evaluate
					- What is really causing the problem?
					- How can the person tackle the problem?
					- What are the person's stressors? Which takes precedence over others?
				- Make positive change regarding:
					- Environment
						- Eliminate some activities from your schedule, change jobs if appropriate, find time to reflect, stay away from people who drain  you
					- Perceptions
						- Try to get a more balanced view of what has happened and how you are responding
					- Body & Mind
						- Get sufficient rest, eat balanced meals, exercise, and practice mindfulness
					- Skills
						- Get additional training for new career or explore further training for current position
				- Stress
					- Anticipate future stress
						- The process of helping people understand what is ahead so they are less surprised, more knowledgeable, and less inclined to be immobilized by fear and uncertainty with the anticipated stressor comes
					- Draw on spiritual resources
						- Reading and reflecting upon Scripture; Prayer
					- Find social support
						- Buidling a support base of friends and family
						- Surrounding yourself with others who can assist with the interventions listed above
						- Researchers have confirmed that the presence and support of other people significantly moderates the effects of stress and makes coping more effective. No man is an island.
					- Give encouragement
						- Provide appropriate Scripture references to provide hope.
				- Depression
					- Signs and Symptoms
						- Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
						- Feelings of emptiness, sadness, and excessive crying
						- Significant weight change
						- Sleep problems
						- Isolation from others
						- Poor concentration; difficulty thinking clearly
						- Feelings of worthlessness; excessive guilt
						- Fatigued; loss of energy
						- Thoughts of death, not necessarily suicide
							- If a client displays 5 or more signs/symptoms consistently for 2 or more weeks, the client is experiencing a depressive episode
							- If a client displays 5 or more signs/symptoms for over 5 weeks, they would likely fit the criteria for major depressive disorder
							- When assessing, look at not only the presence of the symptoms, but also the severity. Does this symptom prevent them from functioning in a normal manner?
					- Causes
						- Significant personal loss
						- Stress
						- Body chemistry
						- Faulty thinking
					- Types of distorted thinking common with depression
						- Magnification
							- Making a mountain our of a mole hill
						- Polarization
							- All or nothing thinking; one way or the other with no wiggle room
							- Everything is black and white; no grey area
						- Personalization
							- Taking things too personally
							- They need to understand that a person's statement often says more about the person saying it than the one receiving it
						- Overgeneralization
							- Uses words like "always" and "never"
							- Makes predictions about the future
						- Selective abstraction
							- Basically concentrating on the negative
							- Don't, can't, or won't see the "big picture"
						- Emotional reasoning
							- "I feel it to be true; therefore it must be true"
							- They need help connecting feeling with fact and rationality
