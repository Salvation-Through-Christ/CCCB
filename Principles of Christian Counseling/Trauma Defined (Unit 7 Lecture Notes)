Trauma Defined (Unit 7 Lecture Notes)
	* Trauma is the "Response to any event that shatters your safe world so that it's no longer a place of refuge" (Wright, 2003)
	* It is "a process initiated by an event that confronts an individual with an acute, overwhelming threat" (James, 2008)
		** Disequilibrium occurs
		** Lasts as long as the mind needs to reorganize, classify, and make sense of the event.
	* Potential Causes
		** Rape
		** Sexual Abuse
		** Loss
		** Physical Violence
		** Hostage Situations
		** Natural Disasters
		** Terrorism and War Zone Experiences
		** School Violence
	* Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
		** (1) Must have been exposed to trauma in which he/she was confronted with an event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to self others' physical well-being.
		** (2) Persistently re-experiences that event in at least one of the following ways:
			*** Intrusive and distressing recollections of the event
			*** Nightmares of the event
			*** Flashback episodes
			*** Intense psychological distress when exposed to triggers
			*** Physiological reactivity to triggers
		** (3) Persistently avoids reminders of the event in at least three of the following ways:
			*** Attempts to avoid thoughts,conversations, or feelings associated with trauma
			*** Avoids activities, people or situations that arouse memories of trauma
			*** Inability to recall important aspects of the trauma
			*** Diminished interest in significant activities
			*** Feels detached and removed emotionally and socially
			*** Restricted range of affect by numbing feelings
			*** Sense of foreshortened future
		** (4) Persistent symptoms of increased nervous system arousal that were not present before the trauma in at least two of the following ways:
			*** Difficulty falling or staying asleep
			*** Irritability or outbursts of anger
			*** Difficulty concentrating on tasks
			*** Constantly being on watch for real or imagined threats that have no basis in reality (hypervigilance)
			*** Exaggerated startle reactions to minimal or nonthreatening stimuli
		** (5) Disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other critical areas of life
			(Dissociation)
	* Impact on Brain
		** A traumatic experience makes changes in the brain and how it processes information
		** Trauma is a wound on the brain
			*** It is a persistent deregulation of the body and brain chemistry
			*** Involuntarily enters into a dissociative state
				**** Physiological responses
				**** Psychological responses
			*** Disconnects the right and left side of the brain
			*** Hippocampus reduced in size
			*** Memory lapses and short-term memory deficits
			*** Frontal cortex ability is decreased making the brain less able to perform executive functioning
			*** Right side of the brain becomes over reactive
			*** Increased amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline secretions
				**** Which trigger the release of more hormones
	* Effective Strategies
		** Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD)
			*** Introductory Phase
				**** Introducing yourself and the group
				**** Talk about the experience
				**** Help others know what is normal
			*** Fact Phase
				**** Allows people to express what they felt during this event
			*** Thought Phase
				**** Asking people to describe their cognitive reactions
			*** Reaction/Feeling Phase
				**** Helps people identify the most traumatic part of the experience
			*** Symptom Phase
				**** Now you are letting them talk about the physical and psychological symptoms they are facing
			*** Teaching/Educational Phase
				**** Makes people aware of the natural reactions and how to overcome it
			*** Reentry Phase
		** Insightful Strategies
			*** Insightful Questioning Helps the Counselee
				**** Tell his/her story
				**** Assess the lingering impact of the trauma
				**** Reframe the event
				**** Attend to coping skills
				**** Establish treatment goals
				**** Take a different perspective
			*** Make sense of flashbacks
			*** Identify triggers
