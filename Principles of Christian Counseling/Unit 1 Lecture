	Stages of Change
		- The Transtheoretical model
			- Model created by Prochaska & DiClemente in 1983
			- Designed to conceptualize the process of intentional behavioral change
			- Classified by various stanges  that a person passes through on their way toward a specific behavior change
			- Time spent in each stage varies from individual to individual although certain tasks are typically accomplished as one passes through each stage
			- People may fluctuate between stages frequently as they work to make change
		- Stage 1
			- Precontemplation
				- People in this stage typically do not plan to make change and may not even see the behavior as a problem or a cause of the certain consequences they experience
				- typically avoid talking about the issue under the consideration for change
				- At this stage, people would be considered resistant and unmotivated
		- Stage 2
			- Contemplation
				- At this point, people begin to consider change and even intend to change within the foreseeable future
				- They are aware of the benefits of changing as well as the cost, which may lead them to linger in this stage for a longer period of time
		- Stage 3
			- Preperation
				- Characterized by the stage in which people have specific intentions to change; likely within the next month
				- People in this stage are ready to take on new tasks and begin to take action
				- They hav already taken small steps (gym membership, smoking cessation classes, etc)
		- Stage 4
			- Action
				- this stage is characterized by the overt changes made over the course of the last six months
				- Examples
					- Abstinence from substance ie: cigarettes, actively attending a gym
		- Stage 5
			- Maintenance
				- change has been made and now work is done to prevent oneself from relapsing
				- confidence in one's change is growing
				- the stage can last from 6 months to up to 5 years depending upon the type of change made
		- Stage 6
			- Termination
				- the point in which a person is no longer tempted and can maintain the change independantly despite physical or emotional stressors
				- Some behavioral changes may be in a lifetime of maintenance, such as exercise and weight control
